It provides a modular structure for integrating various components, such as memory, prompts, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and external tools.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Command Processor**: Handles input commands and dispatches them to the correct modules.\n- **Memory System**: Stores context and agent state in JSON (`memory.json`).\n- **Prompt Factory**: Builds structured prompts for LLM interaction.\n- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Allows knowledge retrieval from files or external sources.\n- **Tooling Support**: Framework for integrating custom tools into the agent.\n- **LLM Interface**: Abstraction layer to connect with any language model backend.\n\n## Build Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- A C++20 (or newer) compiler  \n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (≥ 3.15 recommended)  \n\n### Build Steps\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic_agent.git\ncd basic_agent\n\n# Create and enter the build directory\nmkdir build && cd build\n\n# Configure the project\ncmake ..\n\n# Build\ncmake --build .\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter building, run the agent from the `build/` directory. It will load the index project (`../`)  by default or use a specified workspace. The agent saves the retrieved information to memory.json and responds to commands through its chosen interface.\n\n## License\n\nThe `basic_agent` is licensed under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute it under the terms of the license.\n\n## Roadmap / Ideas\n\n- Add Python bindings for rapid prototyping.\n- Extend RAG to support vector databases.\n- Create plugins for different LLM providers.\n- Implement more robust memory management.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or would like to discuss how to get started with `basic_agent`.",

It provides access to a vast product catalog from various sources.\n2. **Amazon Product Advertising API**: Amazon's API allows you to search for products, retrieve product information, and even make offers to buy or sell products. Keep in mind that you'll need an Amazon Developer account to access this API.\n3. **eBay Find API**: eBay's Find API enables you to search for items on the platform, retrieving relevant details like prices, seller information, and more.\n4. **Google Trends**: While not a direct API, Google Trends can help you identify popular products or trends by analyzing search volume data.\n5. **OpenCorporation APIs**: OpenCorporation provides access to a vast database of company information, including product catalogs and pricing data.\n\nBefore choosing an API, consider the following factors:\n\n*   **Cost**: Some APIs have usage limits, tiered pricing, or require payment for certain features.\n*   **Data accuracy**: Ensure that the data provided by the API is accurate and up-to-date.\n*   **Scalability**: Choose an API that can handle large volumes of requests and queries.\n*   **Availability**: Verify that the API is available 24/7 and has a stable connection.\n\nTo get started, I recommend exploring each option's documentation and evaluating their features to determine which one best fits your web scraping tool's requirements.\n\nDo you have any specific preferences or limitations (e.g., region-specific data) for your chosen API?",
